# MATLAB Optical Simulation Tutorials ðŸ”¬ðŸ’»

Welcome to the **MATLAB Optical Simulation Tutorials** repository! This project is dedicated to providing clear, well-documented, and modular scripts for simulating various optical imaging techniques using MATLAB â€” aimed at students, researchers, and educators working in computational optics, microscopy, and biomedical imaging.

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

This repository contains a growing collection of scripts and tutorials that demonstrate how to simulate core optical imaging processes, including:

- **SIM (Structured Illumination Microscopy)**: Forward model simulation of raw SIM frames under realistic conditions
- **PSF (Point Spread Function) Simulation**: Excitation, emission, and confocal PSFs using the angular spectrum method
- **Fluorescence Image Formation**: Simulated image acquisition with optical blurring and illumination modulation
- ...and more coming soon!

All scripts are written in MATLAB and include step-by-step annotations to help you understand both the physics and the implementation logic.
